Cloud Foundry Service Broker to manage RDS instances and a shared RDS Database.

### Setup
There are important environment variables that should be overriden inside the `manifest.yml` file

> Note: All environment variables prefixed with `DB_` refer to attributes for the database the broker itself will use for internal uses.

1. `DB_URL`: The hostname / IP address of the database
1. `DB_PORT`: The port number to access the database.
1. `DB_NAME`: The database name.
1. `DB_USER`: Username to access the database.
1. `DB_PASS`: Password to access the database.
1. `DB_TYPE`: The type of database. Currently supported types: `postgres` and `sqlite3`
1. `DB_SSLMODE`: The type of SSL Mode to use when connecting to the database. Supported modes:
1. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: The id credential with access to make requests to the Amazon RDS .
1. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The secret key (treat like a password) credential to access Amazon RDS.

> Note the AWS Environment Variables should be generated by following the instructions [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html)

### How to deploy it

1. `cf push`
1. `cf create-service-broker SERVICE-NAME USER PASS https://BROKER-URL`
1. `cf enable-service-access rds-database`


### How to use it

To use the service you need to create a service instance and bind it:

1. `cf create-service rds-database shared-psql MYDB`
1. `cf bind-service APP MYDB`

When you do that you will have all the credentials in the 
`VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable with the JSON key `rds-database`.

Also, you will have a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable that will
be the connection string to the DB.
